Introduction to NLP
NLP involves the interaction between computers and human language. This section introduces the basics of NLP, including common tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

Preprocessing Techniques
Effective NLP requires proper preprocessing of text data. This section covers essential preprocessing techniques such as:

Tokenization
Lowercasing
Removing punctuation and stopwords
Lemmatization and stemming
Exploring Hugging Face Transformers
Hugging Face provides a wide range of pre-trained transformer models that can be easily used for various NLP tasks. This section explores these models and demonstrates how to load and use them for tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, and text generation.

Sentiment Analysis Model using BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful transformer model developed by Google. This section covers the steps to build a sentiment analysis model using BERT, including:

Loading the pre-trained BERT model
Fine-tuning the model on the sentiment analysis dataset
Evaluating the model's performance
Usage
After training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model, you can use it to predict sentiments in new text data. Example usage instructions can be provided in a separate script or Jupyter Notebook.
